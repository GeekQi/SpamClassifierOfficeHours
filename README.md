# SpamClassifierOfficeHours
The code from my codementor office hours on an introduction to machine learning and natural language processing. 

Prerequisites: 

  nltk

  [WEKA] (http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)

To extract the features run "python feature_extract.py".

This will generate an arff file to be opened in WEKA.

I encourage all of you to fork this repo and add your own features to see if you can imporove our results.

Feel free to get in contact with me via codementor (https://www.codementor.io/benjamincohen) with any questions, comments, or concerns.

Thanks for attending my office hours!
